# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to utilize HTML and JavaScript to construct a webpage displaying information from a data base on UFO sightings around the world. Additionally, Bootstrap and CSS is used to customize the page in order to filter through sightings based on criteria such as date, city, and shape.

## Results
In order for the site to be user friendly, we added the ability for the user to search for sightings based on the following criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.

## Summary
The purpose of the website is successful in displaying UFO sightings. However, there are a couple of things that could better help the user in finding what they are looking for. First would be that the search done needs to match the data stored exactly, or no results will be shows. And the second would be that in order to search for multiple sightings, one search must be done and then cleared in order to complete a second search. 

A couple of recommendations for the site would be the ability for the site to refresh after each search. The site now requires you to clear your search before performing another one. The second recommendation would be to allow users to upload their own UFO sightings to broaden the search results for new users in the future.
